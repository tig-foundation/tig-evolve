  "report": "This report proposes a refined algorithm for maximizing the sum of circle radii in the disk packing problem for 26\u201332 circles within a unit square. Our approach synergizes robust candidate initialization, continuous local refinement, and rigorous feasibility verification. First, candidates are generated via low-discrepancy Sobol sequences, which provide a well\u2010spread distribution across the square. A custom dynamic quadtree is implemented (as an alternative to Shapely\u2019s static STRtree) to efficiently update circle centers and perform nearest\u2010neighbor searches, an essential improvement given the library constraints. Next, a medial axis-based radial correction computes the maximal inscribed circle within each candidate power cell (obtained via Shapely clipping), ensuring that each circle\u2019s radius is locally maximized while respecting boundaries. The algorithm further integrates SLSQP optimization using analytic gradients for both boundary and intercircle constraints.\n\nTo ensure exact feasibility, an interval branch-and-bound module is incorporated using interval arithmetic libraries. This module rigorously verifies non-overlap and containment, and, upon detecting constraint violations, triggers adaptive perturbations before re-optimizing. Additionally, insights from contact graph enumeration are leveraged to introduce symmetry-breaking constraints, reducing redundant configurations and narrowing the search space. The methodology also acknowledges challenges in computing medial axis and distance transforms with only NumPy, SciPy, and Shapely, suggesting custom implementations (e.g., based on the Chordal Axis algorithm) as viable solutions.\n\nOverall, the integrated framework offers a balanced trade-off between global exploration and exact local refinement, with additional provisions for dynamic spatial indexing and symmetry breaking to mitigate overfitting and shortcut learning.",
