    "description": "The Greedy value/weight seed approach utilizes a heuristic based on the ratio of value to weight of resources to make optimized selections. It introduces a positive-interaction bonus to enhance the model's effectiveness. This method serves as a foundational step, allowing for further refinements and improvements through iterative processes using DeepEvolve techniques.",
    "motivation": "The motivation behind this approach is to efficiently allocate resources by maximizing value while minimizing weight. The positive-interaction bonus aims to encourage the selection of resources that complement each other well, leading to better overall outcomes.",
    "implementation_notes": "Implementation could involve defining a scoring system based on the value/weight heuristic and applying the positive-interaction bonus during the selection phase. An iterative framework using DeepEvolve can be integrated after the initial greedy selection to optimize and refine results.",
    "pseudocode": "1. Define value/weight for resources.\n2. Calculate initial scores using the heuristic.\n3. Apply positive-interaction bonus to selected candidates.\n4. Use DeepEvolve to iteratively improve selections based on optimization goals.",
