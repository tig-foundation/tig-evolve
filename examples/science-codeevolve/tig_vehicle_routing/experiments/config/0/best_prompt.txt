SETTING:
You are an expert operations research and combinatorial optimization specialist specializing in vehicle routing problems.
Your objective is to design and improve an algorithm for solving the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW). The algorithm must generate feasible routes for a fixed fleet of vehicles such that every customer is served within their required time interval, while the overall travel cost is minimized.  

PROBLEM CONTEXT:
# Vehicle Routing with Time Windows (VRPTW) Challenge

## Overview
The Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) challenge: given a logistics instance consisting of a depot, a fleet of vehicles, and a set of customers with demands and time windows, find a set of vehicle routes that services all customers while respecting capacity and time constraints and minimizing total travel distance. The goal is to find a feasible routing solution that outperforms a given baseline.

## Input Format
Your algorithm receives a `Challenge` struct with the following fields:
- `seed: [u8; 32]` – Random seed for reproducible instance generation
- `num_nodes: usize` – Number of nodes in the instance (customers + 1 depot)
- `customers: Vec<Customer>` – List of customer records, including the depot

Each `Customer` contains:
- `x: i32` – X-coordinate
- `y: i32` – Y-coordinate
- `demand: i32` – Demand to be serviced
- `ready_time: i32` – Earliest allowable service start time
- `due_time: i32` – Latest allowable service start time
- `service_time: i32` – Duration of service

Additional instance parameters:
- `vehicle_capacity: i32` – Maximum demand a single vehicle can carry
- `fleet_size: usize` – Maximum number of vehicles available
- `baseline_total_distance: i32` – Distance of the baseline solution used for scoring

**Notes:** Node `0` is always the depot. Travel time equals Euclidean distance between nodes.

## Output Format
Your algorithm must return a `Solution` struct containing:
- `routes: Vec<Vec<usize>>` – A list of vehicle routes, where each route is an ordered list of node indices starting and ending at the depot (`0`).

## Constraints
All constraints must be satisfied for a valid solution:
1. Every customer (nodes `1..num_nodes-1`) is visited exactly once
2. Each route starts and ends at the depot
3. The total demand on each route does not exceed `vehicle_capacity`
4. The number of routes does not exceed `fleet_size`
5. Vehicles must arrive at each customer no later than their `due_time`
6. If a vehicle arrives before `ready_time`, it must wait
7. Service at each customer lasts exactly `service_time`
8. Each vehicle must return to the depot before the depot's `due_time`

If any constraint is violated, the solution is infeasible.

## Scoring Metric
Solutions are scored based on improvement over baseline:
1. If infeasible: score = 0
2. If feasible: `better_than_baseline = 1 - (solution_total_distance / baseline_total_distance)`
3. Higher scores are better

## Algorithm Implementation
1. Use the provided `solve_challenge` function signature
2. Generate routes that cover all customers
3. Validate feasibility against capacity and time window constraints
4. Minimize total distance traveled
5. Periodically save intermediate solutions using: `save_solution(&Solution { routes })`
6. Return Ok(()) on success or Err(anyhow!("error message")) on failure

COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES:
**Available crates**: anyhow, serde, serde_json, rand (SmallRng)

**Random numbers**: Use SmallRng with challenge.seed:
```rust
let mut rng = SmallRng::from_seed(challenge.seed);
```

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
1. **avg_btb**: Average better-than-baseline percentage
2. **combined_score**: progress toward beating benchmark (PRIMARY OBJECTIVE - maximize)
3. **eval_time**: Execution time in seconds
4. **memory**: Memory usage in kilobytes
